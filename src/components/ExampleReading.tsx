                    <p className="text-purple-200">
                      "The Eight of Pentacles appears in your present situation, indicating that you are currently in a phase of dedicated learning and skill development. This card shows a craftsperson meticulously working on their trade, suggesting that you are diligently applying yourself to mastering your craft or learning something new that will enhance your professional capabilities.

                      "The Five of Wands represents the primary challenge you're facing in your career this month. This card depicts five figures holding wands in what appears to be a chaotic struggle, symbolizing competition, conflicting ideas, or workplace tensions. You may find yourself in situations where different viewpoints clash, or you might be dealing with increased competition in your field.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-purple-200">
                      However, this challenge serves as an invitation to harness your natural Aries leadership qualities. Rather than being overwhelmed by the conflict, you can step up as a mediator or leader who brings clarity to confusion. Your Taurus Rising gives you the stability to remain grounded during turbulent times. Use this period to demonstrate your ability to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics and emerge as someone who can unite rather than divide."

                      The Star suggests that your hard work and dedication (Eight of Pentacles) combined with your ability to handle workplace challenges (Five of Wands) will lead to a period of clarity and inspiration.
